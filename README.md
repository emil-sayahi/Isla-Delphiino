# Isla-Delphiino
An abandoned project.

This was a work-in-progress utility for packaging up a portable copy of the Dolphin emulator and a Wii or Gamecube .ISO into a single, portable package. The main result of this was not a utility, as I eventually learned it was impossible not only because of the legal consequences that I was aware of prior, but also because of the UI code of Dolphin. What I got out of this project was a UI that was an extremely accurate replication of the Wii system settings UI, which showed how good I was in reverse engineering user interfaces.
